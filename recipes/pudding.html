            <li>Unsalted butter</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Baking powder</li>
            <li>Baking soda</li>
            <li>Vanilla extract</li>

        </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine dates and tea in a bowl; set aside to soak for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch round cake pan and line with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Cream 3/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons sugar and butter until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Sift in flour and baking powder and fold into the mixture.</li>
            <li>Add baking soda, vanilla, and espresso granules to the date-tea mixture. Add mixture to the batter and stir to produce a loose, soft, dropping consistency. Pour into the prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.</li>
            <li>When pudding is almost finished baking, combine 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar, 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon brown sugar, 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon golden syrup, and butter for the sauce in a heavy saucepan over low heat until melted. Simmer for 5 minutes, then remove from heat. Gradually stir in cream and vanilla. Return to the heat and stir until smooth, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove pudding from the oven. Spoon a little sauce onto each serving plate. Place a portion of pudding on top, then pour over more sauce. Serve remaining sauce on the side.</li>
        </ol>
